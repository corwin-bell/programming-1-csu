# Module 2 Critical Thinking Assignment: Option 1 - Calculate Average Withholding
Create a program that will calculate the weekly average tax withholding for a customer given the following weekly income guidelines:
- Income less than $500: tax rate 10%
- Incomes greater than/equal to $500 and less than $1500: tax rate 15%
- Incomes greater than/equal to $1500 and less than $2500: tax rate 20%
- Incomes greater than/equal to $2500: tax rate 30%
## Pseudocode
```
Declare class:
	Declare main method:
		Declare float income field
		Assign income field from user input
		Declare float taxWithholding field
		If income less than 0:
			Print income must be greater than or equal to zero
		Else if income less than 500:
			Assign taxWithholding to 0.10 * income
		Else if income less than 1500:
			Assign taxWithholding to 0.15 * income
		Else if income less than 2500:
			Assign taxWithholding to 0.20 * income
		Else:
			Assign taxWithholding to 0.30 * income
		Print taxWithholding
